  <h1>A Happy Ever After</h1>
  <img src="ahappyeverafter.jpg" />
  <p> Wondering why people still look for soul mates. . Is it because they hope that

theirs will be a different case, wanting to taste the waters of love, the pressure

from the outside world to have one, the fear of being lonely or is it for security

purposes. . Wedding bells ring every weekend, vows are made, exclusive million

dollar rings are exchanged as a sign, love in the air, smiles, mirth and glee fills

the atmosphere, kisses all the way to honeymoon, Paris, Bahamas, you name it.

. What happens thereafter?</p>

<p>The same tongue that uttered sweet words, ‘I love you’,’ I’ll never leave you’ ,

being one of them, ends up verbally abusing you or even worse bruising your

heart and well-being by saying, ‘I don’t know why I even married you, I regret

it’, piercing the soul. . That tongue that rolled up in your mouth as you kissed

and made out, expressing your love on a deeper level, ends up spitting on you, a

sign of being worthless in their eyes, even pity doesn’t count, no slightest

emotion whatsoever left. . The same fingers that brushed through your hair,

touched you in intimacy, made you fall for them even more, chemistry it was,

end up throwing glasses at you, poisoning your food or drinks, they wish you

dead or gone for good, slap that same face they once adores and couldn’t stop

staring at even blows to be worse. . That same arm that went around your

waist, supported you during hikes, you fell asleep on, made you feel safe and

protected (ladies can testify to this), the arm that provided the warm shoulder

to cry on and made you feel cared for turns cold, its thrown in the air at your

face, he/she doesn’t care at all anymore, no feeling of security no more. . Those

same eyes that looked deep in yours, watched you fall in a deep slumber, turn

bitter, they no longer notice when something troubles you, the tears shed for

them are empty. .That same voice that whispered in your ear, the one that sang

to you or at least tried to sing harmoniously, becomes loud and shouts at you,

anger overrules and fights are picked up just so he/she can storm out and go

wherever he/she desires. . A turn of events, what went wrong? Love turned

sour or was it pretence? Marriages once based on the foundation of love turn

into two people living as roommates, not the same matrimonial bed, the kids

are what are keeping them together, once they grow old enough to understand,

divorce procedures begin. . A happily ever after becomes a weary one. .

By now you may think I’m a sadist, welcome to the real world of promises not

lived up to, void words and broken vows. . This shouldn’t keep one from running

away from love. . I’m one of those people that still believe in true love despite

all. . I choose to work things out with whoever I’ll walk down the aisle with, give

him my best shot and be the submissive wife, he’s the King of it all and I his

Queen, love and cherish through thick and thin, start from the scratch if so, till

he achieves what he wants and know who he is, but at the same time strive

towards my ambitions. . Till then, I’m giving everyone I have an equal chance to

prove they are worth the future effort. . Meanwhile, all those that are up to the

‘challenge’ can drop their applications and CVs in my email (laughs), just

kidding. .</p>

<p>Choose to be different and be optimistic when it comes to love. . I know mine

will be a Cinderella story with a happily ever after 

Love, Jenny.</p>
